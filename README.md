# Facepunch (Newpunch) Thread Auto-refresh / Auto-update

![Preview](https://tenrys.pw/ShareX/2018/Oct/iSM7.png)

It checks every few seconds for new posts, taking increasingly longer if nothing was found, and resetting on find.

If the script finds out a new page has started, it'll stop looking and tell you, as well as attempt to add a link to the new page in the page navigation.

Supports browser notifications if you leave the tab open, and even changes the tab title until you focus back into the page.

# [Install](https://github.com/Tenrys/newpunch-thread-autorefresh/raw/master/newpunch-thread-autorefresh.user.js)

You need a userscript extension such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey to be installed in your browser for this to work.

Tested on Firefox 62.0.3 (64-bit) and Microsoft Edge 42.17134.1.0, please create an issue if you run into any problems.
